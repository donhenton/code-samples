# code-samples

This is a web site that lists my various sample applications on the web. It is hosted on AWS in an S3 bucket
fronted by CloudFront. 

The site is available at https://samples.awsdhenton.com

This repository is tied to the above website via a CodePipeline project that was creating using [CloudFormation](https://github.com/donhenton/aws-sandbox/tree/master/cf_code_samples_pipeline).
